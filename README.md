# IMGD-07

The shader introduces effects such as soft blurring, color modulation, and dynamic light diffusion that enhance the fluidity of the agents’ movement.

Technically, I was fascinated by how shaders can simulate natural phenomena and add depth to a simple sketch. The shader adds visual interest by emphasizing the continuity of motion and by softening harsh edges, which helps create a more cohesive and immersive composition. However, it also takes away some of the raw clarity and precise definition of each agent, shifting the focus from individual detail to an overall atmospheric effect.

# Feedback From Jessilyn
● I enjoy the blurring effect as it makes it seem like the viewer may be looking at
organisms moving around under a microscope. It definitely adds some backstory and
interest to the animation.
● The posterization was also interesting as it felt like a doodle was being created as the
animation went on.
● Using some of the filters together gave some interesting effects.
● Overall it was fun to mess around with the different filters and experience the effects
they had on the original piece as well as see how much they changed the animation all
together.
